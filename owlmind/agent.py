    Implements the core functionality in Rule-based Agentic systems.
    Agents are components that Sense -> Deliberate -> Act.
    In this component, Deliberate is implemented through Rule-based deliberation, that is:
        - Receives a Command with a goal and local Context (parameters)
        - Deliberate about rules that could process that Command
        - Execute the Actions (=Capabilities) related to these Rules
        
    Actions can be:
        - internal actions such as 'learn new Belief', 'learn new Rule', forget X, etc
        - external actions, implement through functional calling
        - communication actions, sending messages to other agents.

    Internal structures include:
        Beliefs: Belief Base, storing Agent's long-term Memory, used during Deliberation.
        Plans: Rule Base, storing Deliberation Rules as 'goal({condition})->{action}'.
        Capabilities: Capability Base, cataloguing Actions.
